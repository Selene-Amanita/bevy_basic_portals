Bevy Basic Portals is a Bevy game engine plugin aimed to create portals.

Those portals are (for now) purely visual and can be used to make mirrors, indoor renderings, crystal balls, and more!

![Portal Cube example](https://github.com/Selene-Amanita/bevy_basic_portal/assets/134181069/9864c08c-7826-4b4a-bea1-082c4434fd74) ![Moving portals and destination example](https://github.com/Selene-Amanita/bevy_basic_portal/assets/134181069/14474b43-c5df-41ca-9d60-cb604fb4997b) ![Mirror example](https://github.com/Selene-Amanita/bevy_basic_portals/assets/134181069/b34e34b7-08ca-483c-8ff7-d31869e1b22d)

## Basic Usage
This example illustrates how to create a simple portal, it uses a single sphere that will be displayed two times on screen thanks to the portal:
```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;
use bevy_basic_portals::*;

fn main() {
    App::new()
        .add_plugins((DefaultPlugins, PortalsPlugin::MINIMAL))
        .add_systems(Startup, setup)
        .run();
}

fn setup(mut commands: Commands, mut meshes: ResMut<Assets<Mesh>>) {
    commands.spawn((
        Camera3d::default(),
        Transform::from_xyz(-20.0, 0., 20.0).looking_at(Vec3::ZERO, Vec3::Y),
    ));

    let portal_mesh = meshes.add(Mesh::from(Rectangle::new(10., 10.)));
    commands.spawn((
        // This component will be deleted and things that are needed to create the portal will be created
        CreatePortal {
            destination: AsPortalDestination::Create(Transform::from_xyz(20., 0., 0.).into()),
            // Uncomment this to see the portal
            /*debug: Some(DebugPortal {
                show_window: false,
                ..default()
            }),*/
            ..default()
        },
        Mesh3d(portal_mesh),
    ));

    let sphere_mesh = meshes.add(Mesh::from(Sphere::new(2.).mesh().uv(32, 18)));
    commands.spawn((
        Mesh3d(sphere_mesh),
        MeshMaterial3d::<StandardMaterial>::default(),
        Transform::from_xyz(20., 0., -5.),
    ));
}
```
More complex examples are available in the examples folder.

## Vocabulary
- A Portal is an entity used to visualise the effect
- A Main Camera is a camera used to visualize the effect
- A (portal) Destination is an entity representing the point in space where a portal is "looking"
- A Portal Camera is a camera being used to render the effect, its position to the destination is the same as the main camera's position to the portal
- All of those are Portal Parts, their references are stored in a separate entity

## Known limitations
(may be fixed in the future)
- portals created by this crate are uni-directionnal, you can only look from one space to the other,
if you want a bidirectional portal you can crate two portals manually
- this crate doesn't handle "portal recursion", as in viewing a portal through another portal
- portals created by this crate have no visible borders (not counting aliasing artifacts), you can "see" them with `DebugPortal`
- this crate doesn't handle moving stuff through the portal, it is only visual, more like a crystal ball
- this crate doesn't handle raycasting through the portal, it has to be done manually
- this crate doesn't handle changing the portal's or the destination's scale
- this crate doesn't handle changing camera settings after creation
